### **Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the Connect Me: Digital identity in One QR code app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices which was created by Nkpozi Marcel Kelechi (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have as a user.

## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as

*   The pages of the Application that you visit (analytics),
*   The time spent on the Application

Note: The information will be utilized for the provision of better service. Additionally, this information will not include that which will identify the individual user. 

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Email, Name, Phone, website, address, postal, education, work history, and links. The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

## Cookies  
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as an anonymous unique identifier. These are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device’s internal memory.  
Our app does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, it may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and to improve our services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service. 

## Third Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. 

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

*   [Google Play Services](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/)
*   [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

The Service Provider may disclose user-provided and Automatically Collected Information:

*   as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process;
*   when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect their safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
*   with their trusted service providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete the data that you have provided via the Application, you can do so on the app or contact us at connect.me.assist@gmail.com and we will respond in a reasonable time.

## Children

 This section of our privacy policy is specifically for children below 13 years old, as we care deeply about protecting your privacy and ensuring that you have a safe and enjoyable experience while using our app.

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy.
